    <h1><b>KERALA-CHERISH EVERY SECOND</b></h1>
    <P>Kerala is a state on the southwestern Malabar Coast of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956.Kerala is one of the smallest states of India. The state stretches along the Malabar coast on the western side of the Indian peninsula, is sandwiched between the hills of the Western Ghats on its eastern edge, the Arabian sea on the western edge and is bordered by the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.</P>
    <p>God’s own country is a phrase that was first used in the context of Kerala by Vipin Gopal in 1993. Later, the Kerala state tourism development corporation adopted it as the brand for its tourism promotion campaigns. The National Geographic Magazine has named Kerala as one of the ten paradises of the world. Trivandrum (now Thiruvananthapuram) is the capital of Kerala.</p>
    <p>Exploding palms and trumpeting elephants, temple dances that thunder into the night, colourful festivals, serene churches, enchanting byways and elegant snake boat races make Kerala a land of stunning beauty and yes God’s own country…</p>
